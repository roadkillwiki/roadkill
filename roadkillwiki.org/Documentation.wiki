==Editing pages==


==User roles==
Roadkill has just two types of user roles: standard users and admins. The only difference between the two is that users who belong to the admin role can access the site settings page, and delete pages.


==Exporting/backing up the site==
The site settings page allows you to export your site data in an easy to use XML format. Clicking the export button in the Export section to do this. An import facility will be part of Roadkill in the coming months.

==Markup types==
Roadkill enables you to edit your Wiki in three different flavours of markup language:

* [[http://www.wikicreole.org|Creole Wiki]]
* [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown|Markdown]]
* [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting|Media Wiki format]]

It is recommended that you keep with Creole Wiki format as this is best supported by the platform. The WYSIWYG editor is fairly experimental for the other two formats, and only a subset of the Media Wiki features are supported.
