=====TESTING WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION=====

This can be done by creating a new Windows 2012 server and running into inside VirtualBox or on EC2.
With VirtualBox, ensure you have 'Bridged Adapter' set for the network, this allows you to access 
IIS on the virtual server from the host computer.

To setup the box from fresh and perform manual tests:

Install IIS (including application support). Create a site, and make sure it's on port 80 with no host name,
delete the default website if needed.

Install Active Directory Domain Services
Call your domain Contoso.com (you'll need a new forest).
Add two user groups: RoadkillEditors, RoadkillAdmins
Add two users:
BobAdmin - RoadkillAdmins
EricEditor - RoadkillEditors

The Roadkill ldap settings are then:
-	ldapConnectionString: LDAP://contoso.com
-	ldapUsername: administrator
-	ldapPassword: Passw0rd

Use SQLite for the database.


To test, connect to the server in your browser from the host machine using for example contoso\bobadmin and Passw0rd.
(The server won't allow you to login as BobAdmin or EricEditor as they're not administrators of the domain.)


The roadkill.config looks like this:

<roadkill
	adminRoleName="RoadkillAdmins"
	attachmentsFolder="~/App_Data/Attachments"
	useObjectCache="false"
	useBrowserCache="false"
	logging="none"
	logErrorsOnly="true"
	connectionStringName="Roadkill"
	dataStoreType="SqlServerCe"
	editorRoleName="RoadkillEditors"
	installed="true"
	isPublicSite="true"
	useWindowsAuthentication="true"
	ldapConnectionString="LDAP://contoso.com"
	ldapUsername="administrator"
	ldapPassword="Passw0rd"
	version="2.0.0.0"
