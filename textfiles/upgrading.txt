Upgrading to version 1.7
==================================

Before upgrading, please make a back up of your database and website. To upgrade, copy your <roadkill> section into a text editor, 
then copy all the files except any database file you are using in App_Data (if you're using SQLite or SQL Server CE).

Then copy your <roadkill> section back into your web.config file. Yes - it's messy - but this will be easier in 1.8.

The custom tokens filename has changed, and is now known as "customvariables.xml" in the App_Data folder.
If you have changed your tokens.xml, you will need to rename this to "customvariables.xml".

Once everything is complete, you should update your web.config so the roadkill section's
version="1.6.0.0" is set to version="1.7.0.0".
