# Roadkill Developer Readme

### Pre-requisites

To setup Roadkill on a developer machine, you will need to:

* Visual Studio 2013 (2012 should also work)
* Typescript installed - http://www.typescriptlang.org
* SQL Server Express 2012 or better, although you can configure Roadkill to work with SQL Server CE or SQLite if you prefer.
* An NUnit runner (NUnit, Resharper, Dotcover etc.) if you want to run the tests. This is required if you want to contribute.

### Fresh install

To get a 'fresh' Roadkill installation on your development machine, you will need to do the following:

* For IIS: create a new site with a .NET 4 application pool. Roadkill also works with IIS Express.
* If you're using SQL Server: create a database called "roadkill". Run the `/lib/Test-databases/roadkill-sqlserver.sql` script.
  * If you want to use SQLite or SQLServer CE, empty databases can be found `/lib/Test-databases/SqlCE` or Sqlite.
* You can also install Roadkill using the unattended url, e.g.: http://localhost/install/Unattended?datastoretype=sqlserver2008&connectionstring=database=roadkill;uid=sa;pwd=Passw0rd;server=.\SQLEXPRESS


### Build scripts

There are 4 build scripts that automate the builds:

* build.ps1 - runs msbuild with the solution file
* devbuild.ps1 - builds and copies all files required for a dev build, zips the files and then pushes the zip file to the 'RoadkillBuilds' repository on Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/yetanotherchris/roadkillbuilds).
* releasebuild.ps1 - The same as devbuild.ps1 but uses the `release` build configuration and only produces a zip file.
* mono.releasebuild.ps1 - Uses the the `mono` build configuration. 

### Running Roadkill on Azure
Roadkill can be run using a website deploy on Windows Azure. The instructions for this can be found on the [Roadkill wiki](http://www.roadkillwiki.net/wiki/13/azure-website-deployments)

### Syncing with Git

Mercurial (Bitbucket) hosting is synced with Github and Codeplex Git hosting using the Hg-To-Git plugin for Mercurial. These commands are then run:

- hg pull -u
- hg bookmark -f master
- hg push git+ssh://git@github.com/yetanotherchris/roadkill.git

Codeplex is then synced from Github using `git push --all https://git01.codeplex.com/roadkill`
